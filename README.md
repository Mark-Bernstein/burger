# burger

This app uses JavaScript, HTML, CSS, MySql, Node, Express, Handlebars, and a homemade ORM to log out burgers.
The MVC design pattern was used along with Node to Query the route data for the app. Handlebars was used to generate all of my HTML.

Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the upper part of the page, waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a "Devour it!" button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the bottom part of the page. In addition, the app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
